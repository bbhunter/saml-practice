Welcome to the Flask SAML2 documentation
========================================

Flask SAML2 helps you build Identity Providers and Service Providers (SP) for your applications.
Each application will likely be either an Identity Provider (IdP) or a Service Provider (SP),
so follow along with the relevant sections of the documentation for the particular needs of your application.
